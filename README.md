## My studies

I was a student at **School 42** in Brussels.  
There I learned to code in **C / C++**, but more importantly, I learned *how to learn* from and with my peers.  
It was an invaluable experience and I gained a lot from it.

## My experience

I worked as a **full stack developer** at Neo Mobility with Python and Javascript, Postgres and Odoo. 

I participated in the **international internship program** with **CDG-Group in Bangkok (TH)**, where I worked with **Flutter** and helped prototype a **full-stack application**.

My previous experience in other languages played a huge role in quickly adapting to a technology I didn’t know much about beforehand.
