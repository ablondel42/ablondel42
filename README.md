<h2>&nbsp;My studies</h2>
<p>I was a student at Campus19, the 42School in Brussels. There I learned to code in C / C++, but mainly, I learned how to learn from and with my peers. It was an invaluable experience and I've gotten so much out of it.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;My latest experience</h2>
<p>I participated in the international internship program with CDG-Group in Bangkok (TH) where I had the opportunity to learn about Flutter, and do the first drafts of a full-stack application. My previous experiences in other languages played a huge role in prototyping an app on a technology that i didn't know much beforehand. It was great and i learned a lot of valuable skills.</p>
